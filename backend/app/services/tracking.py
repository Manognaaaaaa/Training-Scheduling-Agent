"""Tracking: what has actually been completed, week by week, and who is falling behind.

Everything here reads the database once (``load_facts``, a fixed number of queries) and then
works on plain Python objects. The forecasting and risk code reuses the same ``TrackingFacts``
so the dashboard never runs a query per course.

Definitions (used everywhere, keep them in one place):
- ``is_completion``: what counts as a completion.
- ``week_index_dates``: the weeks of the year (Sunday to Saturday).
- ``target_pace``: where we should be by now if the target were spread evenly over the year.
- ``eligible_pool``: how many drivers could still complete a course.
